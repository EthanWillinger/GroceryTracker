# GroceryTracker

The goal of this project is to reduce food waste and help the user save money. The application will reduce food waste by ensuring that the users are notified before their groceries expire. This way, users save food and money by using their groceries before they go bad and if they notice they purchase too much of an item that expires quickly, they can adjust their purchase habits accordingly.
